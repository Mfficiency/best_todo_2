# Best To-Do 2

üìù Swipe-first, ultra-fast to-do app built with Flutter. Tasks default to today. Move with gestures. Notes, labels, and smart rescheduling.

## Fundamentals
1. less than 1 second cold startup
2. it must not be possible in less clicks/steps
3. open source

## üöÄ MVP Features
- Add task: description, note, labels
- Tasks default to today
- Swipe right: reschedule to tomorrow, 2d, next week, next month
- Local DB: Hive or Isar
- <1s cold startup
- Unit and widget test coverage

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
flutter build apk --release
```

When running the app on Chrome, swipe gestures can be hard to test.
Each task tile includes a **swipe** icon that performs the same action
as dragging the tile. Use this button to simulate a swipe when testing
in the browser.

## üèóÔ∏è Building Releases
Run the helper script in the `tool` directory to build production
artifacts. The script automatically bumps the patch version and names
the build output with the version number.

```bash
sh tool/build.sh <platform>
# Example: sh tool/build.sh apk # for Android APK
```

For example `sh tool/build.sh web` will create a folder like
`build/web-0.1.4` containing the compiled app.

## Issues

### build the android file
when you get issue with the android build, try to run
```bash
flutter create .
flutter pub get
```
