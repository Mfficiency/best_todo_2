## After MVP
### TODO
- calendar view
- add home to menu
- in your stats, hide the date picker when not in dev mode
- on the start screen, have 3 buttons, populate with example data or start fresh or import previous data
- 1 working automatic test when building or pushing
- add a simplified mode
- delete all, select before delete
- have a way to sent a notification about that item in 5- 20 or 60 minutes
- recurring tasks
- extra stats, when is the most productive day. When is the most productive time? When is the time where I plan the most? Which day do I postpone the most? All those kinds of variants 

### DONE
- the widget should have a line showing how much of the tasks have been completed today, 3 or less left is green, 4 orange, 5 or more will be red, the line is ful aand green when all tasks are completed. example: If I only have two tasks for today and none completed, there's just a grey line visible, if i complete one than the line will be 50% green. This whole think can be turned on or of in the settings.
- So I want, on the page of my stats, another tab where I can just have, for each day, a graph. I want to see how many tasks I had at the beginning of the day, at the end of the day, and how many were completed at the end of the day.so it will be a vertical bar of blocks, the hight of the bar is total amount of tasks. a red block is a task that was there in the beginning of the day but moved to another date, dark green is a task that was there in the beginning of the day and got completed, dark grey is a task that was there in the beginning of the day and did not get completed. light green is a task that wasn't there in the beginning of the day (so was created during the day) and got completed, light grey is a task that wasn't there in the beginning of the day and did not get completed. so every day has the day of the month under it
